One of the challenges of deploying a Dockerized Node.js application is managing database migrations, especially when using an ORM like Prisma. In this guide, we'll explore how to deploy such an application on Digital Ocean's App Platform while ensuring that Prisma migrations are handled correctly.

We'll cover database setup, app deployment, and automated migrations.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A Docker image pushed to Docker Hub (public or private)
- A Digital Ocean account
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Prisma

## 1. Set up a Database Cluster

First, let's create a managed PostgreSQL database:

1. Navigate to **Managed Databases** in your Digital Ocean dashboard
2. Create a new database cluster:
   - Choose the **lowest tier** for cost optimization
   - Select **PostgreSQL** as the database type
3. **Important**: Do not add "Trusted Sources" yet, as this will prevent the API service from connecting during the initial deployment
4. Copy the **connection string** from the cluster settings - you'll need this later
5. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to become ready before proceeding

> **Note**: We'll secure the database with trusted sources later in the process.

## 2. Deploy Your App via App Platform

### Create the Application

1. Go to **App Platform** and click **Create App**
2. Choose **Deploy from a container registry**
3. Select **Docker Hub** as your registry
4. Configure your container:
   - **Image name**: `your-docker-username/your-app-name:latest`
   - **Authentication**: Only required for private repositories (use username and token)

### Configure Environment Variables

Set up your environment variables:

- `SERVER_URL`: Use the dynamic variable `${APP_URL}`
- `DATABASE_URL`: Paste the connection string from your database cluster
- Add any other required environment variables

### Set the Correct Port

Change the default port to match your application's configuration (e.g., port `5001`).

Click **Save** to deploy your application.

## 3. Handle Database Migrations

After deployment, your app will start successfully, but any Prisma-dependent endpoints will fail because the database tables don't exist yet. You have several options to handle migrations:

### Option A: Manual Migrations ❌

Manually connecting to the database to run migrations is not recommended for production environments.

### Option B: Auto-migrations on App Start ⚠️

While you could modify your Dockerfile to run migrations on startup, this approach has drawbacks:

- **Race conditions**: Multiple instances might try to run migrations simultaneously
- **Scaling issues**: Not suitable for horizontally scaled applications
- **Production concerns**: Even with Prisma's migration locks, this isn't ideal for production

### Option C: Separate Migration Service ✅ **Recommended**

Create a dedicated migration job that runs before your app starts.

## 4. Create a Migration Job

### Add the Migration Job

1. Go back to your App Platform application
2. Click **Add Resources** → **Create resources from source code**
3. Choose **Container Image** and select **Jobs**
4. Configure the job:
   - **Image**: Use the same Docker image as your main app
   - **Tier**: Choose the cheapest option (migrations are lightweight)
   - **Environment Variables**: Add `DATABASE_URL` with your database connection string

### Configure Job Trigger

In the **Job Trigger** section:

- Select **Before every deploy**
- **Build command**: Override the default Dockerfile command with:

  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate deploy
  ```

This command tells Digital Ocean to run Prisma migrations instead of starting the application.

Click **Save** to create the job.

## 5. Final Deployment

Digital Ocean will now redeploy your application with the following sequence:

1. **Migration job runs first**: Applies any pending database migrations
2. **Main app starts**: Only after migrations complete successfully
3. **Failure handling**: If migrations fail, the deployment stops and the app won't start

Monitor the deployment logs to verify everything works correctly.

## 6. Test Your Application

### Health Check

Test the basic functionality:

```bash
GET /api/health
```

Expected response: `200 OK` with a success message.

### Database Operations

Try creating a new user or performing other database operations to confirm Prisma is working correctly.

## 7. Secure Database Connection (Recommended)

### Attach Database to App

1. In App Platform, go to your application
2. Click **Add Resources** → **Create or attach Database**
3. Select **Attach existing DO database**
4. Choose your running database cluster
5. Select the appropriate database name and user
6. Add the API app as a **trusted source**
7. Click **Attach Database**

### Update Environment Variables

After the deployment completes:

1. **Main App**: Replace the hardcoded `DATABASE_URL` with the dynamic variable:

   ```
   ${db-postgresql-nyc3-25166.DATABASE_URL}
   ```

2. **Migration Job**: Update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with the same dynamic reference

This setup provides:

- ✅ Secure database connections
- ✅ Automated migrations
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Production-ready deployment pipeline

## Important Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Digital Ocean environment variables don't include trailing slashes
  - Example: `CLIENT_URL = "https://your-app.pages.dev"`
- **Consistency**: Apply the same URL format when setting `VITE_SERVER_URL` in other platforms like Cloudflare

## Conclusion

You now have a fully functional Digital Ocean setup with:

- A running API service
- Managed PostgreSQL database with secure connections
- Automated migration capabilities
- Production-ready deployment pipeline

This architecture ensures your database schema stays synchronized with your application deployments while maintaining security and reliability.
