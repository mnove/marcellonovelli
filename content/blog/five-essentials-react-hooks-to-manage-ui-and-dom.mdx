# 5 Essential React Hooks for UI and DOM Management

Working with the DOM in React can be tricky. You're dealing with responsive layouts, scroll behaviors, hover states, and element measurements - all while keeping your components clean and performant. The good news? There are specialized hooks that make DOM manipulation feel as natural as managing regular state.

These 5 hooks have become my go-to tools for handling UI interactions and DOM-related challenges. They'll help you build responsive, interactive interfaces without the usual headaches of direct DOM manipulation.

## 1. useMediaQuery - Responsive Design Made Easy

> See code for: [useMediaQuery](https://unlogg.com/docs/unlogg-hooks/ui-and-dom/use-media-query)

Tired of writing CSS media queries and then duplicating the same logic in JavaScript? `useMediaQuery` brings CSS media query power directly into your React components.

### When to use it:

- Responsive component rendering
- Conditional feature loading
- Adapting to user preferences (dark mode, reduced motion)
- Device-specific functionality

### The Hook:

```typescript
function useMediaQuery(
  query: string,
  options: {
    defaultValue?: boolean;
    initializeWithValue?: boolean;
  } = {}
): boolean;
```

### Real-world example:

```tsx
function ResponsiveNavigation() {
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery("(max-width: 768px)");
  const isDarkMode = useMediaQuery("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");
  const prefersReducedMotion = useMediaQuery("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)");

  return (
    <nav className={isDarkMode ? "dark" : "light"}>
      {isMobile ? (
        <MobileMenu />
      ) : (
        <DesktopMenu 
          animated={!prefersReducedMotion}
        />
      )}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

**Why it's awesome:** It handles SSR gracefully, respects user preferences, and keeps your responsive logic co-located with your components. No more guessing what breakpoint triggered a re-render!

## 2. useScrollIntoView - Smooth Scrolling Without the Complexity

> See code for: [useScrollIntoView](https://unlogg.com/docs/unlogg-hooks/ui-and-dom/use-scroll-into-view)

Need to scroll to elements programmatically? `useScrollIntoView` handles smooth scrolling, respects user preferences, and gives you full control over the behavior.

### When to use it:

- "Skip to content" links
- Form validation (scroll to error)
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Search result highlighting

### The Hook:

```typescript
function useScrollIntoView<T extends HTMLElement = HTMLElement>(
  options: ScrollIntoViewOptions = {}
): [React.RefObject<T | null>, UseScrollIntoViewReturn];
```

### Real-world example:

```tsx
function FormWithValidation() {
  const [errorRef, { scrollIntoView }] = useScrollIntoView({
    behavior: "smooth",
    block: "center"
  });

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const errors = validateForm();
    
    if (errors.length > 0) {
      // Smoothly scroll to the first error
      scrollIntoView();
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <Input name="email" />
      <div ref={errorRef} className="error">
        {/* Error message appears here */}
      </div>
      <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

**Smart feature:** It automatically respects `prefers-reduced-motion` settings, falling back to instant scrolling when users prefer less motion. Accessibility built-in!

## 3. useHover - Interactive UI Made Simple

> See code for: [useHover](https://unlogg.com/docs/unlogg-hooks/ui-and-dom/use-hover)

Hover states are everywhere in modern UIs. `useHover` makes detecting hover states clean and reusable, without the usual event listener boilerplate.

### When to use it:

- Tooltips and popovers
- Interactive cards
- Button hover effects
- Conditional content display

### The Hook:

```typescript
function useHover<T extends HTMLElement = HTMLElement>(
  elementRef: React.RefObject<T | null>
): boolean;
```

### Real-world example:

```tsx
function InteractiveCard() {
  const hoverRef = useRef(null);
  const isHovered = useHover(hoverRef);

  return (
    <div
      ref={hoverRef}
      className={`card ${isHovered ? "elevated" : ""}`}
    >
      <h3>Product Name</h3>
      <p>Product description...</p>
      
      {/* Only show actions on hover */}
      {isHovered && (
        <div className="actions">
          <Button>Add to Cart</Button>
          <Button variant="outline">View Details</Button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Performance tip:** Unlike CSS `:hover`, this hook lets you conditionally render expensive components only when needed, keeping your app snappy.

## 4. useElementSize - Responsive Components That Actually Respond

> See code for: [useElementSize](https://unlogg.com/docs/unlogg-hooks/ui-and-dom/use-element-size)

Container queries are the future, but `useElementSize` brings element-based responsive design to React today. Track any element's dimensions and respond to changes in real-time.

### When to use it:

- Container-based responsive design
- Canvas or SVG sizing
- Dynamic layout calculations
- Responsive text sizing

### The Hook:

```typescript
function useElementSize<T extends HTMLElement = HTMLDivElement>(): [
  React.RefObject<T | null>,
  ElementSize
];
```

### Real-world example:

```tsx
function AdaptiveChart() {
  const [containerRef, { width, height }] = useElementSize();

  // Adjust chart complexity based on available space
  const showDetails = width > 600;
  const showLegend = height > 400;

  return (
    <div ref={containerRef} className="chart-container">
      <Chart
        width={width}
        height={height}
        showDetails={showDetails}
        showLegend={showLegend}
        data={chartData}
      />
      
      {width > 0 && (
        <p className="size-info">
          Container: {width} Ã— {height}
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Real-world win:** Perfect for creating truly adaptive components that respond to their container size, not just the viewport. Your charts, grids, and complex layouts will thank you.

## 5. useMobile - Mobile Detection Done Right

> See code for: [useMobile](https://unlogg.com/docs/unlogg-hooks/ui-and-dom/use-mobile)

Mobile detection sounds simple, but it's full of edge cases. `useMobile` handles SSR, custom breakpoints, and provides a clean API for mobile-specific logic.

### When to use it:

- Mobile-specific features
- Touch vs mouse interactions
- Performance optimizations
- Progressive enhancement

### The Hook:

```typescript
function useMobile(
  breakpoint: number = 768,
  options: UseMobileOptions = {}
): boolean;
```

### Real-world example:

```tsx
function ImageGallery() {
  const isMobile = useMobile(768, {
    defaultValue: false, // SSR-friendly
    initializeWithValue: false
  });

  return (
    <div className="gallery">
      {isMobile ? (
        // Mobile: Touch-friendly carousel
        <TouchCarousel images={images} />
      ) : (
        // Desktop: Hover-based grid
        <GridWithHover images={images} />
      )}
      
      {/* Mobile-specific features */}
      {isMobile && (
        <SwipeHint>Swipe to see more images</SwipeHint>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**SSR-friendly:** Unlike naive `window.innerWidth` checks, this hook handles server-side rendering gracefully and won't cause hydration mismatches.

## Putting It All Together

Here's how these hooks work together in a real component:

```tsx
function SmartWidget() {
  const [widgetRef, { width }] = useElementSize();
  const hoverRef = useRef(null);
  const isHovered = useHover(hoverRef);
  const isMobile = useMobile();
  const prefersReducedMotion = useMediaQuery("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)");
  const [scrollTarget, { scrollIntoView }] = useScrollIntoView();

  const isCompact = width < 300;

  return (
    <div ref={widgetRef}>
      <div
        ref={hoverRef}
        className={`widget ${isHovered && !isMobile ? "hover" : ""}`}
      >
        <h3>Smart Widget</h3>
        
        {/* Responsive content based on actual size */}
        {isCompact ? (
          <CompactView />
        ) : (
          <FullView />
        )}
        
        {/* Mobile-specific interactions */}
        {isMobile ? (
          <TouchControls />
        ) : (
          <MouseControls />
        )}
        
        {/* Hover-based actions */}
        {isHovered && !isMobile && (
          <ActionButtons
            animated={!prefersReducedMotion}
          />
        )}
      </div>
      
      {/* Scroll target for focus management */}
      <div ref={scrollTarget} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Wrapping Up

These 5 hooks solve the most common UI and DOM management challenges you'll face:

1. **useMediaQuery** - Responsive design and user preferences
