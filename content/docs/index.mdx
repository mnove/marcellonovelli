# Hello, I'm Marcello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **web engineer** and **product designer** who thrives at the intersection of design and engineering. I believe the best digital experiences come from understanding both the technical possibilities and the human needs behind every product.

## My Journey

Originally rooted in **product management** and **head of operations**, my career has evolved toward what I'm most passionate about: **full-stack web development** and **open source** contributions. This unique background gives me a holistic perspective on building productsâ€”from initial strategy and operations to detailed implementation and user experience.

## What I Do

### ðŸŽ¨ Design + Engineering
I combine aesthetic sensibility with technical expertise to create digital experiences that are both beautiful and functional. My design background ensures that every line of code serves a purpose in the overall user experience.

### ðŸš€ Full-Stack Development
Focused on modern web technologies and best practices, I build scalable applications that solve real problems. My operations background helps me think about performance, maintainability, and user impact from day one.

### ðŸŒŸ Open Source
I believe in the power of community-driven development and contribute to open source projects that make the web more accessible and developer-friendly.

## My Approach

Having worn many hatsâ€”from product strategy to operations managementâ€”I bring a **systems thinking** approach to every project. I understand that great software isn't just about clean code; it's about solving real problems for real people in sustainable, scalable ways.
