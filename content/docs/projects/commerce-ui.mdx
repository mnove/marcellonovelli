**Role:** Lead Maintainer & Design Engineer
**Technologies:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Fumadocs


Led the development and maintenance of stackzero/commerce-ui, a collection of components to build e-commerce sites and commerce apps. Built for React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui . Spearheaded the creation of an open-source component library that accelerates e-commerce development through reusable, customizable UI components and design patterns.

### **Key Contributions:**
- **Component Architecture**: Designed and built a comprehensive library of reusable components and design patterns for building commerce sites , including both atomic components and complex blocks for specific e-commerce contexts
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Implemented the library using cutting-edge technologies including React, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui design system, and Framer Motion for animations, ensuring optimal performance and developer experience
- **Copy-Paste Philosophy**: Architected a "copy-paste" library approach that allows developers to easily copy components' code and paste it into their projects , providing maximum flexibility for customization
- **Documentation Excellence**: Built comprehensive documentation using Fumadocs, creating an intuitive developer experience with clear examples, installation guides, and usage patterns
- **Design System Integration**: Leveraged shadcn/ui components and design patterns to ensure consistency in global styles, typography, and spacing across all components
- **Open Source Leadership**: Managed community contributions, issue tracking, and feature requests while maintaining code quality and project roadmap
- **CLI Integration**: Developed installation tooling that enables developers to install components via CLI or manual copy-paste methods

### **Technical Impact:**
The library has significantly reduced development time for e-commerce projects by providing production-ready components that maintain design consistency while offering full customization capabilities. Licensed under MIT, the project enables free use in personal and commercial projects , fostering widespread adoption in the developer community and contributing to the open-source ecosystem.

### **Project Structure:**
- **Components**: Small, self-contained UI pieces designed for flexibility and reusability
- **Blocks**: Larger UI sections composed of multiple components for specific e-commerce contexts like product pages and checkout flows
